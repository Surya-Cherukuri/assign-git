What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by Git are not affected.
For a Java Project, the following filetypes should be included in .gitignore:
# Compiled class file
*.class

# Log file
*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

What does fast-forward in Git mean?

When you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit’s history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together – this is called a “fast-forward.”

Why should you have different branches?

Multiple branches allows you to organise the workflow more efficiently because features can be developed independently on feature branches and merged with master. It also provides context during the build process(CACD pipeline).

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

We can have as many repositories as possible but only one named repo "origin".
